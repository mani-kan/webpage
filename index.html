            <p>Hi guys how are have nice day all of you my name is gmk i am a youtuber at gmk tech&creations please do subscribe our channelA microwave is a signal that has a wavelength of one foot (30.5 cm) or less. This
                converts to a frequency of 984 MHz, so all frequencies above 1000 MHz (1 GHz) are
                considered microwaves. The frequencies immediately below this border are considered ultrahigh frequencies. The upper end of the microwave range contains the light frequencies, about
                1015 MHz.
                Normally microwaves spread outwards as they travel through the atmosphere and
                disappear without effect. The microwave oven uses microwaves of frequency 2.4 GHz (12.5
                cm wavelength) to cook food. Microwave ovens have a magnetron usually concealed in the
                roof of the oven, specifically designed to make use of the energy in the microwaves. Electricity
                applied to the magnetron tube is used to create microwave energy.
                Microwaves enter the cooking area through openings inside the oven. A turntable or
                tray is located at the bottom of the oven. Microwaves cannot pass through the metal walls of
                the oven, but they can penetrate such materials as glass, porcelain and paper, the materials out
                of which microwave-safe cookware is constructed. Microwaves do not heat cookware, though
                cooking vessels will eventually get hot from the heat generated by the food.
                4 concave reflectors are located on the left and back sides to concentrate the microwave
                energy on the food. In state-of-art microwave ovens, the wave reflector system (WRS) and
                dual-wave emission system (DES), Fig. 1.2, ensure that the food is always uniformly cooked.
                Microwaves reflect off the metal components in the oven (such as the interior walls and
                the fine screen on the oven door). These metal parts prevent the escape of microwave energy.
                All microwave activity remains inside the oven. When the door is opened or the oven is
                switched off, the production of microwaves stops instantly.
